# Building claritynotes.co: From Problem to Product

The story behind claritynotes.co starts with a simple frustration: why is it so hard to take proper scientific notes in the digital age?

## The Problem: Digital Note-Taking for Science

During my time at EPFL and NTU, I noticed a universal struggle among students and researchers. We all wanted to take digital notes for our chemistry, physics, and mathematics courses, but existing tools were failing us:

- **Google Docs**: You have to constantly insert equations and special characters
- **Notion**: Requires inserting blocks and typing awkward LaTeX commands
- **Obsidian**: Lacks the flexibility needed for scientific notation
- **Overleaf**: Too cumbersome for quick note-taking

Everyone was either reverting to pen and paper (and losing the benefits of digital) or struggling with these inadequate tools.

## The Solution: Seamless Scientific Writing

claritynotes.co was born from this frustration. The vision is simple: create a note-taking platform where scientific notation feels as natural as typing regular text.

### Key Features We're Building:

1. **Intuitive LaTeX Integration** - No more clunky blocks or complicated shortcuts
2. **Real-time Collaboration** - Share and edit notes with lab partners seamlessly  
3. **Smart Templates** - Pre-built layouts for common scientific document types
4. **Cross-platform Sync** - Access your notes anywhere, anytime
5. **Export Flexibility** - Generate PDFs, LaTeX files, or web-ready documents

## The Journey: From Idea to Implementation

### Phase 1: Validation
Before writing a single line of code, I conducted user interviews with students and researchers at EPFL. The response was overwhelmingly positive - this was a real pain point that needed solving.

### Phase 2: Partnership
I teamed up with my friend Kai, a talented developer I met during my exchange at EPFL. While I focused on product design and user experience, he handled the initial technical implementation.

### Phase 3: Solo Development
When Kai had to focus on his career transition, I took over the technical development. Coming from a chemical engineering background, this was a significant challenge. But thanks to modern development tools and AI assistance, I've been able to push forward with "vibe coding."

## Early Success & Recognition

The project has already gained some traction:
- Positive reception at EPFL's innovation showcase
- Won funding from NTU's entrepreneurship program
- Growing waitlist of beta users
- Recognition from professors who understand the problem firsthand

## Technical Challenges & Learnings

Building claritynotes.co has been a crash course in full-stack development:

### Frontend Challenges:
- Creating a smooth, responsive editor experience
- Implementing real-time LaTeX rendering
- Designing an intuitive user interface for complex functionality

### Backend Considerations:
- Building a robust collaboration system
- Optimizing for real-time synchronization
- Planning for scalability from day one

### The "Vibe Coding" Approach:
As someone without a traditional CS background, I've learned to leverage:
- AI coding assistants for guidance and debugging
- Open-source libraries to avoid reinventing the wheel
- Community forums and documentation for learning
- Rapid prototyping to test ideas quickly

## What's Next?

We're currently in private beta with select users from EPFL and NTU. The feedback has been incredibly valuable in shaping the product direction.

### Upcoming Milestones:
- Public beta launch (Q2 2025)
- Mobile app development
- Advanced collaboration features
- Integration with popular academic platforms

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with a real problem** - The best products solve genuine pain points
2. **Talk to users early and often** - Assumptions are dangerous; validation is crucial
3. **Embrace your beginner's mind** - Not having a traditional background can be an advantage
4. **Build in public** - Sharing the journey creates accountability and community
5. **Focus on the MVP** - Perfect is the enemy of good enough

The journey of building claritynotes.co is far from over, but it's been an incredible learning experience. It's taught me that with enough curiosity, persistence, and the right tools, you can build solutions to problems you care about - even without a traditional technical background.
