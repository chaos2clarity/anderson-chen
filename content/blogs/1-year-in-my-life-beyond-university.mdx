## One year away from university

In September 2024, I left NTU for a semester exchange at EPFL. After that, I returned to Taiwan for a six-month internship, and now I'm taking a gap year until 2026 august, that's another year away from NTU, with the possibility of more to come.

Why call it "a year away from university"? When I got admitted to EPFL as an exchange, it felt less like an academic detour and more like a breakout. For the first time, I could choose courses purely out of curiosity, I had the flexibility to immerse myself in 12 different courses in one semester and then dropping some before exams. Many courses like VC/PE, data analysis, diffusion didn't end up counting toward my credit transfer, and I didn't mind, because it was just refreshing to learn when I feel genuinely curious about something. Most of my time was spent running trial-and-error experiments with a friend, we built cool, silly, and sometimes entirely impractical projects; applied to YC; joined YC's startup school; took part in different programs; travelled; talked about life; wrote blogs; took photos.

Then came my compulsory internship (yes, I still had to pay full tuition fees for this self-sourced, six-month position). After work, I threw myself into coding, and read books on energy and geopolitics, which unexpectedly rekindled some appreciation for chemical engineering lol. I had coffee chats with CEOs and founders across industries, just to learn about their life stories and how they solved certain problems. Most of the time, I felt like I was making up for the exploratory work I failed to do in high school, and the "education" I'm trying to give myself now is somewhat an attempt to re-run the "purpose searching phase" and replenish my curiosity and purpose. Most importantly, this past year, though technically spent "away from university", has reshaped the way I approach many things, and it makes me really look forward to the upcoming gap year I have at Jamie's Gap Year program.

Anyways, I recently wrapped up my internship, officially starting my gap year. So I want to share some of my plans and conclusions to close this chapter and get myself ready for the upcoming gap year.

## One year away from university, future plans?

I have three more concrete plans in mind.

### 1. Prepare to apply to Minerva (as a transfer or graduate)

I came know more about Minerva because I got to know a few Minerva alumni who were quite sucessful founders across industries. (I always knew Minerva existed, just that in highschool I thought it was a scam) and I realized this was probably the school I've envisioned myself to be in.

Two years at ntu and I realized I wasn't well adapted to the classic university model. I was doing everything right yet nothing stuck past midterms or finals. It wasn't really about liking or disliking chemical engineering, because since high-shcool I've known that my real obsession is never certain subjects, but learning fundamental logic behind things and apply it to solve problems.

Take entropy: instead of just memorizing how to use clausius defintion of G=H-TS, I tried to dive deeper, and it was these "aha" moments from manual search and purpose driven learning that I couldn't resist to share with my girlfriend and family, and those were the moments that stayed with me.

But the approach didn't fit to the grading systems, I wasted a lot of time exploring things (mostly reading and not applying) that didn't really matter (womp womp). The year which I felt like I learned the most, I got the worst grades. The next semester I changed my learning approach, I spent most of my study time grinding past year papers and textbook question banks, my GPA immediately got a boost, just that the trade-off was nothing truly retained. It was a paradox of learning. I often doubted my ability to learn because of moments like this, until I slowly gained a clearer perception of my own brain works through trials & errors. I just had to bridge my knowledge with the real-world, I had to apply and understand core logics behind things, and I had to share it with others.

That's why Minerva sounded like a right place for me (shit, this is starting to feel like a college essay). I held quite a lot of doubts, because 3 years ago, I was still telling all my friends Minerva was a scam with artifically manipulated low acceptance rate. And now I'm here trying to apply for it, haha. (Good reminder for myself to touch grass and talk to real humans and stop relying on reddit)

And yea, Minerva is a not a widely recognized university for its learning model, students get thrown to different cities, all online classes, no real college campus, people thinking it's a scam (and that's on Minerva for their horrendous advertising strategy in 2022 by spamming our emails). I can already imagine the amount of "explanation" work I'd have to do (sounds like negative aura). But at the end of the day, I feel like what's more important is how effectively it helps me bridge the gap between classroom and real world, and since Minerva quite literally doesn't have a classroom, I believe it will excel at this job.

### 2. Venture Capital as a leveraged environment for learning

I recently had the chance to get involved in VC work in Hong Kong and China, including participating in two Series C funding rounds for promising startups in the US and China in the AI and infrastructure sectors. I was lucky the dots I drew in the realm of startup somehow connected and got me to this opportunity.

It's been my first real exposure to VC, meeting founders, joining due diligence processes, and sitting in on countless dinners and calls. What's made it so rewarding is how much I've been able to learn directly from founders who are deeply knowledgeable in their fields and willing to explain their industries and companies in clear, fundamental terms. This makes VC fun, it's an incredibly leveraged environment for learning new things, and I want to keep myself engaged in this field, and use the opportunity to observe how founders work, communicate and manage, learn how people solve hard problems that others can't.

### 3. Build something I care about and ship it

After EPFL, I decided to learn "real coding" (without da vibes) and became a little addicted to it, it feels empowering to build prototypes of ideas. Now I want to ship something I crafted, not "vibed". Currently building an education/college prep platform derived from my original tutoring business and investigating into the issue of athletes education in taiwan. Don't have much to write about yet. But a goal I am going to set for myself is to ship at least one product that I truly give a sh*t about in the upcoming year and have at least one user who truly give a sh*t about my product.

### 4. Stop trying to take strides

In the past year I've had many ambitious attempts, some failed, some gave sparks, but I ended up losing passion for it completely. For the next year, I want to take smaller steps, and be patient with anything I do.

## One year away from university, thoughts?

### Learn with purpose

I want to continue to learn with purpose.

### Write

Writing helps me to make sense of where I am, and close chapters. It gives me a clarity to plan the next stage with purpose.

### Depth

I hope to learn with more depth, don't just chase the learning dopamine.

### Talk with adults

Gap year is one of the few opportunities for me to engage in deep talks and work with people who are older than me (or people outside of my echo chamber) in college, and I highly value this opportunity. I hope to keep touching grass and talking to real humans.
